## 📝 Project Description

New API is a self-hosted AI gateway for applications, agents, and teams. Connect upstream model services, expose a consistent API to your clients, and manage routing, access, usage, and costs in one place.

Use it to share authorized model access across a team, switch providers without configuring every client again, or operate a private multi-model service with a web console. Upstreams include OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Azure OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, Vertex AI, DeepSeek, Qwen, and other compatible services.

### Server-to-server balance integration

Root administrators can manage **Integration clients** under **System Settings → Authentication**.
Creation, secret rotation and enable/disable operations require a signed-in browser
session and the existing security-verification flow. A service client is **not**
a root user: its only permission is `balance:read`; it cannot access dashboard,
user-management or model-inference APIs.

Copy the client ID and secret after creation. Secrets are displayed once, stored
only as SHA-256 verifiers of cryptographically random values, and expire after
90 days. Rotate before expiry. Rotation or any status change immediately revokes
previous access tokens, including after a client is re-enabled.

The calling **backend**, never the browser, exchanges its credentials over HTTPS:

```http
POST {site-base-url}/api/integration/v1/token
Authorization: Basic base64(form-url-encoded-client-id:form-url-encoded-client-secret)
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

grant_type=client_credentials&scope=balance%3Aread
```

The response contains `access_token`, `token_type: "Bearer"`, `expires_in`
(at most 300 seconds) and `scope: "balance:read"`. Cache the token server-side
until shortly before expiry; no refresh token or password grant is supported.
Then call the single available business endpoint:

```http
GET {site-base-url}/api/integration/v1/balance?subject={url-encoded-oidc-sub}
Authorization: Bearer {access_token}
```

```json
{
  "data": {
    "remaining": "17.283",
    "unit": "CNY",
    "symbol": "¥",
    "as_of": "2026-10-28T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

The example amount is illustrative. `remaining` is a decimal string in the
site's configured display unit (`USD`, `CNY`, `CUSTOM`, or `TOKENS`); `TOKENS`
means internal quota points, not a promise of a fixed number of model tokens.
This is the account's remaining wallet balance, not an API key limit or unused
subscription allowance. It is a display snapshot using the gateway's existing
quota source, not a transactionally reserved spending authorization.

Include any deployment subpath in `{site-base-url}`, for example
`https://example.com/new-api`. Responses are marked `no-store`. Token issuance
is limited to 20 requests/minute/IP, and balance reads to 120 requests/minute/client,
in addition to the existing global API limits. Honor `429` and `Retry-After`.
Unknown, disabled or ambiguously bound users return `404 account_not_available`;
authentication failures return `401`; temporary failures return `503`, never a
success-shaped zero balance. Queries do not create accounts. Use a short timeout
and optionally cache per-user card data for 15–30 seconds without blocking login.

**Trust boundary:** each client is intended for a trusted first-party backend
authorized to read balances for users of the configured OIDC identity source.
That backend must derive the subject from its verified login session, not an
arbitrary browser parameter. New API uses an exact match against the stored OIDC
`sub`, not email or display name. Different OIDC clients can receive pairwise
subjects: arrange an authorized stable mapping with the identity provider first.
Each integration client is pinned to the gateway's OIDC issuer and client ID;
changing either makes it inactive. This interface is not third-party delegated
user authorization and must not be handed to untrusted clients.

Security design references: OWASP ASVS **5.0.0**, requirements **9.1.1–9.1.3**
(signature/algorithm/key validation), **9.2.1–9.2.3** (expiry, purpose and audience),
**10.3.1–10.3.3** (resource scope and stable identity), **10.4.4**, **10.4.10–10.4.11**
(restricted grant, confidential-client authentication and least privilege), and
the OWASP Authentication, Session Management, OAuth2 and CSRF Prevention Cheat
Sheets. This implementation uses short-lived bearer tokens and `client_secret_basic`,
not mTLS/DPoP or `private_key_jwt`; it does not claim ASVS Level 3 or certification.
Production must terminate HTTPS securely and keep secrets/tokens out of reverse
proxy, request-body and authorization-header logs. Service credentials are also
rejected before dashboard or relay legacy-key database lookups.

### Canonical console path and legacy API compatibility

The production ingress template uses `/mem-ai/` as the primary console URL and
retains `/new-api/` as a compatibility mount for the same New API service.
Legacy console GET/HEAD requests redirect to the corresponding `/mem-ai/`
page, preserving the path and query. Management APIs, model APIs (including
streaming and WebSockets), Midjourney routes and source archives remain
directly proxied at both mounts. POST bodies and authorization headers are
not moved through browser redirects.

Build the frontend with `VITE_APP_BASE_PATH=/mem-ai` and
`VITE_CORRESPONDING_SOURCE_URL=/mem-ai/source.tar.gz`, and configure the server
with `APP_BASE_PATH=/mem-ai`. Keep HTTPS-only, host-only session cookies scoped
to the application, not the domain root. Existing `/new-api/` browser sessions
may need to sign in again after migration; do not broaden cookie scope or copy
credentials into URLs to bypass this.

An existing registered OIDC redirect URI such as `/new-api/oauth/oidc` can stay
unchanged: that browser page redirects to `/mem-ai/oauth/oidc`, while the server
continues using the exact registered URI for authorization and token exchange.
Keep state, nonce, PKCE and browser binding checks enabled. In-flight login
flows started before migration may need restarting. No identity-provider
wildcard callback or application credential change is required.

Migration controls follow the OWASP Authentication, Session Management and
OAuth2 Cheat Sheets: fixed same-origin redirects, restrictive cookie paths,
HTTPS, and unchanged authorization-code and CSRF verification. This changes
deployment URLs only, not the New API / QuantumNous project identity.

### Relay reliability diagnostics

With `ERROR_LOG_ENABLED=true`, supported synchronous relay HTTP endpoints also
write one terminal observation per request to `relay_outcomes` in the **primary**
database. This is separate from billing logs and per-attempt error logs. It
distinguishes success, failure, cancellation, rejection and incomplete responses;
HTTP 200 alone does not establish stream completion. WebSocket sessions and
asynchronous task lifecycles are not included in this HTTP dataset.

Observations contain bounded client-family and endpoint classifications, model
and final channel, attempt count, latency, unknown-aware first-response timing,
and validated JSON shape flags. Request-size buckets measure **body bytes**, not
prompt tokens. Client family is inferred from User-Agent and is not an
authenticated identity. No prompt text, tool names, image data, raw User-Agent,
user identifiers, IP addresses, credentials or upstream error messages are saved
in these observations. Missing/unparsed features must not be interpreted as
negative observations.

Persistence is best effort: a bounded 1024-entry queue, one worker and a
three-second write timeout keep diagnostics off the request's database path.
Monitor accepted/written/dropped/failed/queued counters before interpreting
success rates. Hourly indexed cleanup removes at most 500 observations older
than 30 days; this is a bounded cleanup policy, not an exact TTL at high volume.
Existing consume/error logs now use the same normalized client-family tags.

Claude channels are excluded from unsupported embedding, rerank, image and audio
routes before sending upstream or reserving request quota. Add an actually
capable upstream to serve those endpoints; advertising a model name alone does
not implement a protocol. Streaming responses are never transparently replayed
after downstream output has started.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - This project is intended solely for lawful and authorized AI API gateway, organization-level authentication, multi-model management, usage analytics, cost accounting, and private deployment scenarios.
> - Users must lawfully obtain upstream API keys, accounts, model services, and interface permissions, and must comply with upstream terms of service and applicable laws and regulations.
> - Users should ensure their use complies with upstream terms of service and applicable laws and regulations.
> - When providing generative AI services to the public, users should comply with applicable regulatory requirements and fulfill all filing, licensing, content safety, real-name verification, log retention, tax, and upstream authorization obligations required by their jurisdiction.

<!-- -->

> [!WARNING]
> When operating this project as a public generative AI service or API resale service, users should first complete all required filing, licensing, content safety, real-name verification, log retention, tax, payment, and upstream authorization obligations.

[RelayKit](./relaykit/README.md) provides request, response, and streaming conversion between the four text protocols. Available features depend on the channel, upstream model, and conversion path; protocol-specific tools and fields may not map exactly. WebSocket support also requires a compatible upstream and channel configuration.

This README describes the current source tree. Check the release notes for the version you deploy.

<a id="quick-start"></a>

## Quick start

### Try locally with Docker

This starts a single instance with SQLite and binds it to localhost:

```bash
mkdir -p data
docker run --name new-api -d --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 \
  -e TZ=Asia/Shanghai \
  -v "$(pwd)/data:/data" \
  calciumion/new-api:latest
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and complete the setup wizard to create the administrator account. The `data` directory persists the SQLite database across container replacements.

### Make your first request

1. Add a channel with your upstream API key, available models, and group assignment; run a channel test.
2. Configure model pricing and ensure the user has quota or a valid subscription.
3. Create an API key in the console with access to the same group and models.
4. Set your client's base URL to `http://localhost:3000/v1` for OpenAI-compatible clients and use the **New API-issued key**.

Set `NEW_API_KEY` in your shell to that key. List the models accessible to it:

```bash
curl --fail-with-body http://localhost:3000/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${NEW_API_KEY}"
```

Then call Responses, replacing `your-enabled-model` with an enabled model that supports this interface:

```bash
curl --fail-with-body http://localhost:3000/v1/responses \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ${NEW_API_KEY}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"model":"your-enabled-model","input":"Hello!"}'
```

<a id="deployment"></a>

## Deployment

### Docker Compose

The repository's [Compose configuration](./docker-compose.yml) starts **New API + PostgreSQL + Redis** by default. It also contains examples for MySQL and a separate ClickHouse log database.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/QuantumNous/new-api.git
cd new-api
```

Before starting, edit `docker-compose.yml`: replace the database and Redis example passwords in both the services and connection strings, and set a persistent random `SESSION_SECRET` (generate one with `openssl rand -hex 32`). For an HTTPS console, configure `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true` and `SESSION_COOKIE_TRUSTED_URL` with its exact public HTTPS origin.

```bash
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f new-api
```

### Storage and configuration

| Component | Options |
| --- | --- |
| Main database | SQLite, MySQL ≥ 5.7.8, or PostgreSQL ≥ 9.6 |
| Separate log database | Configure with `LOG_SQL_DSN`; also supports ClickHouse |
| Cache | Optional Redis plus in-memory caching; use shared Redis when application nodes need shared rate limits |
| Container platforms | Linux amd64 / arm64 |

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `SQL_DSN` | Main database connection; unset uses SQLite |
| `LOG_SQL_DSN` | Optional separate log database connection |
| `REDIS_CONN_STRING` | Redis connection string |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Persistent authentication secret; all nodes must use the same value |
| `CRYPTO_SECRET` | Defaults to `SESSION_SECRET`; nodes sharing Redis must use the same effective value |
| `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` | Set to `true` for an HTTPS console; enables Secure refresh cookies and strict refresh/logout origin checks |
| `SESSION_COOKIE_TRUSTED_URL` | Required in Secure mode: comma-separated exact HTTPS origins, without paths or wildcards; leave unset for local HTTP |
| `TRUSTED_PROXIES` | Trusted reverse-proxy IPs/CIDRs, or `none`; explicitly configure for your network |

See the [environment example](./.env.example), [environment reference](https://docs.newapi.ai/en/docs/installation/config-maintenance/environment-variables), and [authentication and session guide](./docs/authentication.md) for full configuration. Configure container variables in Compose's `environment` or `env_file`; copying `.env.example` alone does not inject variables into the container.

For production, put the console behind HTTPS and configure your reverse proxy for streaming and WebSocket upgrades. Persist and back up the database and mounted data. Multi-node deployments must share the main database and authentication secrets; separate Redis instances or in-memory rate limiters count limits independently per node. The session guide describes propagation behavior for each topology.

Pin an image version from [Releases](https://github.com/QuantumNous/new-api/releases), review its upgrade notes, and back up before upgrading. The `latest` tag follows published builds and can change; migrations and compatibility must be assessed for your existing installation.

<a id="development"></a>

## Development and extensions

The backend uses Go and Gin. The web console uses React 19, TypeScript, Rsbuild, TanStack, and Tailwind CSS 4. Use Bun for frontend dependencies and scripts; see [go.mod](./go.mod) for the Go language baseline and [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) for the container build toolchain.

Build the frontend before starting the backend, which embeds `web/dist`:

```bash
# Repository root
cd web
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run build
cd ..
go run .
```

In a second terminal, start the frontend development server:

```bash
cd web
bun run dev -- --port 5173
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173); the development server proxies API requests to the backend on port 3000. For a containerized development backend, see [docker-compose.dev.yml](./docker-compose.dev.yml) and the `make dev` target in [makefile](./makefile).

| Location | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| `router/`, `middleware/`, `controller/` | HTTP routes, access checks, and API handlers |
| `relay/` | Upstream adapters and request routing |
| `service/`, `model/` | Business logic and persistence |
| [relaykit/](./relaykit/README.md) | Independently buildable Go module for protocol DTOs and conversions |
| [plugins/tasks/](./plugins/tasks/) | JavaScript task plugins; see [Task Plugin API v1](./docs/plugin-api/v1.md) for authoring and host boundaries |
| `web/` | Web console; see [frontend conventions](./web/AGENTS.md) |
| [electron/](./electron/README.md) | Desktop wrapper and packaging |

Read [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) before contributing. Run checks appropriate to your change, including `make test` for the Go modules and `bun run typecheck`, `bun run lint`, `bun run test`, and `bun run build` in `web/` for frontend changes. Changes to RelayKit must also pass `GOWORK=off go build ./...` from `relaykit/`.
